# StartupBox-Phase1

This is the entry to StartupBox Project...
Write a program which when given links to two images on the Internet, finds out how similar they are.
Bonus points if it ranks images on a similarity scale from 0 - very different to 100 - exactly the same.

# Description

There are two files, one html and one Python cgi.. The html file is used to read url from the user and is sent to the cgi script...
The cgi script reads the links and fetches them for further processing...

The software was coded in a linux server with apache... the html file goes into public directory and cgi script goes into cgi-bin directory...
The python code required PIL or Pillow to run... 

#Usage

Just navigate to test.html on the browser and enter the two links... 

# Advantages

This is built from users point of view and to make the user experience ggod as possible...
The user doesn't have to bother about messing with code, or installing the dependencies or compiler etc...
User friendly web interface...
All processing happens in server side... so no load on client...
